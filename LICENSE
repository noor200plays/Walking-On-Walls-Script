Walking On Walls Script
																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																													

Feel free to edit and learn from the script.

Do note, however, that just because you *can* learn from the script doesn't mean you *should*.
I am by no means an amazing scripter at all and it's very rare that I leave any meaningful comments,
so if you're new to Lua and intend to dive into this script to learn more, I would not recommend it.
There are plenty of better sources for learning, such as the Roblox wiki (wiki.roblox.com) which
contains many really good tutorials and examples. I reference it anytime I need to know more about a
Roblox feature. It's probably the best place to start. This script is large and poorly documented,
which may be overwhelming to someone who's new to the wonderful world of Lua.

Overall, if you are interested in learning, or would like to make your own script, I'd recommend
doing that instead of using this script or any other premade scripts.
While this script, and scripts like it, provide a lot of functionality, most people will never need
half of what it can do. If you have the time there's a nice beginner tutorial over on the wiki that
teaches you the basics of how to make your own script:



Anyway, Thanks for checking this out and reading my ramblings!
